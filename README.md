# multilingual-speech-recognition
reating a multilingual speech recognition model that works without needing any additional training, using an existing pre-trained multilingual speech model like Multilingual Whisper. This project aims to empower the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to handle tasks in multiple languages, enhancing its capabilities beyond single-language.
# Multilingual Speech-to-Text and Text Processing Pipeline
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for converting spoken language in various languages into text using OpenAI's Whisper model, and then translating and summarizing the text using the MarianMT and BART models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Features
Speech Recognition: Convert audio files into text using the multilingual capabilities of Whisper.
Translation: Translate the transcribed text into multiple languages using MarianMT.
Summarization: Summarize the transcribed text using BART for concise content.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or above
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/multilingual-speech-text-pipeline.git
cd multilingual-speech-text-pipeline
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the speech-to-text transcription:

python
Copy code
from transcribe import transcribe_audio

audio_path = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3'
transcribed_text = transcribe_audio(audio_path)
print("Transcribed Text:", transcribed_text)
For translating text:

python
Copy code
from translate import translate_text

translated_text = translate_text(transcribed_text, 'en', 'fr')  # English to French
print("Translated Text:", translated_text)
For summarizing text:

python
Copy code
from summarize import summarize_text

summary = summarize_text(transcribed_text)
print("Summary:", summary)
Project Structure
transcribe.py: Contains the function transcribe_audio which uses Whisper for speech recognition.
translate.py: Contains the function translate_text using MarianMT for translation.
summarize.py: Contains the function summarize_text using BART for summarization.
requirements.txt: Lists all the Python dependencies.
